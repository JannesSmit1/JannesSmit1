Hi I'm Jannes Smit. I'm a Software Engineer currently operating in the FinTech industry creating machine learning models on banking data. 

My specailties lie ib MATLAB programming, but I am trying to diversify my skillset by learning Python. My repository mainly contains my attmepts at Python programming and I'd like 
to collaborate on projects where I can learn the basics of Python, specifically using Python with ML.
